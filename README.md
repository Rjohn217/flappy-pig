# Flappy Pig Demo

Welcome to the Flappy Pig Demo, a fun and playful spin-off of the classic Flappy Bird game in a world where pigs can fly!

## Description

This is a demo project for a freelance opportunity to create a game for an online website to interact with their community. The game is built using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.

## Getting Started

To try out the game, simply download the project files and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The game is played by clicking on the canvas to make the pig flap its wings and avoid the obstacles.

## Credits

This game was created by Richard Johnson for the purpose of demonstrating their game development skills. The sound effects used in the game are from Pixabay and Fesliyan Studios.
